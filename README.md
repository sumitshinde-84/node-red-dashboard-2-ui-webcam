The Node-RED Dashboard 2.0 Webcam Widget is a UI widget node designed to facilitate image capture directly from the Dashboard 2.0 interface. This widget enables users to capture images from their device's webcam seamlessly within Node-RED.

## Installation:
Ensure that you have previously installed Dashboard 2.0 before proceeding with the installation of the ui-webcam widget.

 ***Using the Node-RED Editor***:
- Navigate to Editor > Menu > Manage Palette > Install.
- Search for @sumit_shinde_84/node-red-dashboard-2-ui-webcam and install it.

***Using Command Line:***
- Run the following command in your Node-RED user directory (typically ~/.node-red):
  ```
  npm i @sumit_shinde_84/node-red-dashboard-2-ui-webcam
  ```

## Usage

The **ui-webcam** node provides the following functionalities:

* **Live Image Display:**
  Displays a live video feed from the deviceâ€™s webcam in the Dashboard 2.0 interface.

* **Image Capture:**
  Users can click a capture button to take a snapshot.
  The captured image is sent as a **Base64-encoded PNG** string with the following format:

  ```json
  {
    "image": "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0K... (truncated)",
    "captureType": "manual",
    "timestamp": "2025-08-25T14:25:05.993Z"
  }
  ```

* **Automated Image Capture:**
  Sending a `msg.payload` with the string `capture` will trigger an automatic image capture without user interaction.
  The output format will also include `"captureType": "manual"` since it is equivalent to a normal capture.

* **Automated Camera Control:**
  The widget can be turned on or off programmatically by sending a `msg.payload`:

  * To **turn on** the camera: `msg.payload = "on"`
  * To **turn off** the camera: `msg.payload = "off"`

* **Camera Selection:**
  Users can select a different camera by clicking the three-dot icon in the widget and choosing from available devices.

* **QR Code Auto-Detection (New):**
  When the camera feed contains a QR code, the widget can automatically detect and capture the image.
  The captured image will include `"captureType": "qr-detection"`:

  ```json
  {
    "image": "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0K... (truncated)",
    "captureType": "qr-detection",
    "timestamp": "2025-08-25T14:25:05.993Z"
  }
  ```

## Browser Support

The webcam widget is compatible with all modern browsers, except Internet Explorer. 

If you are accessing the Dashboard 2.0 remotely (not via `localhost`), then you must
use HTTPS otherwise the browser will block access to the webcam.

## Privacy

Before the webcam can be activated, the browser will ask the user's permission for
the page to access the device. The node cannot capture images until the user
has given their permission.
